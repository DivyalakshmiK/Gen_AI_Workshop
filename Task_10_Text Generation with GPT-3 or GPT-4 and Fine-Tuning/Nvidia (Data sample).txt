NVIDIA Corporation: An In-Depth Overview

 1. Origin and History of NVIDIA
NVIDIA Corporation was founded on April 5, 1993, in Santa Clara, California, USA by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem. The company was established during a time when computing was beginning to expand beyond just CPUs and into GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), which would later define NVIDIA’s role in the technology industry.

The founders identified a gap in the market for hardware capable of handling the growing complexity of 3D graphics in games and professional applications. They envisioned a processor capable of offloading graphical computations from the CPU, enabling smoother visuals and better performance. The company started with the ambition of creating "the best 3D graphics accelerator for the PC."
